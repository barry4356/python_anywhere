## Overview
Our characters work together to defend the bridge against waves of enemies. Loger and Dresden teleport to the bridge and hold against the onslought, while El Tigre fights his way through zombies, ghouls, undead wolves and undead archers. After pushing the enemy back of the bridge, our heroes hold their ground until the last of the undead falls. They then scavenge from a nearby abandoned town and continue on their way...
