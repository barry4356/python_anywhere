![Fortress](../static/images/IMG_20240908_175247589_HDR.jpg "Fortresss")

## Overview
Our characters move through a forrest outside a walled fortrest. After killing a group of zombies, and investigating the area, the heroes sneak over the walls into the fortress. A heated battle insues, with drained soldiers, undead dogs, and zombies attacking from within the keep, and a giant bat leading an ambush from the forrest through the open gates. Dresden provides overwatch from the keep's tower, as Loger and El Tigre hold back the horde. El Tigre fainted from exurtion, but was rescued by Loger, and the trio escaped the fortress after completing their investigation, before reinforcements could arrive...
